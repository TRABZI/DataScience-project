Many events and characters in the movie are allegedly based on real life, although they may have been exaggerated.
The character of Stevo is based on the life of writer/director James Merendino, although the character is named after Stephen Egerton, originally known as Stephen &quot;Stevo&quot; O&#39;Reilly, who played for</IIMBTBOX:article>

The film outlines the daily lives of two punks in Salt Lake City in the summer of 1985. The film is shot in a documentary, &quot;slice-of-life&quot; style, with frequent voiceovers by Stevo (Matthew Lillard), who narrates the film in past-tense, and his best friend &quot;Heroin&quot; Bob (Michael A. Goorjian). The nickname is ironic, since Bob is afraid of needles and actually believes that any drug (with the&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

A new constitution was introduced in 1937 that declared it an entirely sovereign state and named it simply as Ireland.

During the Iron Age and early medieval period, Wales was inhabited by the Celtic Britons. A distinct Welsh national identity emerged in the centuries after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations today. In the 13th century, the defeat of Llewelyn by Edward I completed the Anglo-Norman conquest of Wales and brought about centuries of English occupation. Wales was subsequently incorporated into England with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535&amp;#8211;1542, creating the legal entity known today as England and Wales.

He is also a co-founder of Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company.
He remained largely unknown to the West, until Miramax released his 1997 Princess Mononoke. By that time, his films had already enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan until Titanic (1997) came out a few months later, and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards.</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">His later film, Spirited Away, had that distinction as well, and was the first anime film to win an Academy Award, topping Titanic in the Japanese box office. Howl&#39;s Moving Castle was also nominated, but did not receive the award.
Miyazaki&#39;s films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity&#39;s relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki&#39;s feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women; with the exceptions of The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, his films often depict&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

Many South Korean historians dispute this association, because other Korean history books place Asadal around the Liao River located in western Manchuria.

Nemesis acted as a swan song for The Next Generation cast, as could be seen from the film&#39;s tagline of &quot;A generation&#39;s final journey begins&quot;. The film was the least commercially successful in the franchise, and was poorly received by the majority of critics.

Verona and several neighboring towns were all originally one town known as the Horseneck Tract. In 1702, a group of settlers left Newark and purchased a large tract of land northwest of their home city for the equivalent of a few</IIMBTBOX:article>

This piece of land extended west and north to the Passaic River, south to the town center of what would become Livingston, and east to the First Watchung Mountain, and was called Horseneck by the natives because it resembled the neck and head of a horse.
What was then known as Horseneck contained most of the present day northern Essex County towns: Verona, along with Caldwell, West Caldwell, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell, and Roseland are all located entirely in Horseneck, and parts of what are today Livingston, Montclair, and West&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

Historically, English originated from several dialects, now collectively termed Old English, which were brought to the eastern coast of the island of Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers beginning in the 5th century. English was further influenced by the Old Norse language of Viking invaders.
After the time of the Norman conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, borrowing heavily from the Norman-French vocabulary and spelling conventions. The etymology of the word &quot;English&quot; is a derivation from the 12th century Old English englisc from Engle, &quot;[the] Angles&quot;.

Originally situated on Tombo Island, one of the &amp;#206;les de Los, it has since spread up the neighboring Kaloum Peninsula.
The population of Conakry is difficult to ascertain, although the U.S. Bureau of African Affairs has estimated it at 2 million. Even given this uncertainty, Conakry makes up almost a quarter of the population of Guinea.
According to a legend, the name of the city comes from the</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">fusion of the name &quot;Cona&quot;, a wine and cheese producer of the Baga people, and the word &quot;nakiri&quot;, which means in Sosso the other bank or side.

The city was essentially founded after Britain ceded the island to France in 1887. In 1885, the two island villages of Conakry and Boubinet had fewer than 500 inhabitants.

Cuyahoga Falls was formed in 1812 near the junction of what was then Northampton, Stow, Tallmadge, and Portage townships. The focus was the series of Cuyahoga River waterfalls that provided power for manufacturing.
In 1812 Kelsey and Wilcox built a dam on the Cuyahoga River at a place where a railroad bridge crossed it in 1876. They then built a flour mill, an oil mill, and a saw mill.

The name of Wallasey originates from the Germanic word Walha, meaning stranger or foreigner, which is also the origin of the name Wales. The suffix &amp;#8220;-ey&amp;#8221; denotes an island or area of dry land.

Old maps show that the main centre and parish church (St Hilary&amp;#8217;s) were located at what is now called Wallasey Village, and there were smaller hamlets at Liscard, Poulton and Seacombe, from where there were occasional ferries across the Mersey.

On November 30, 1538, Sucre was founded under the name Ciudad de la Plata de la Nueva Toledo by Pedro Anzures, Marqu&amp;#233;s de Campo Redondo.

Very much a Spanish city during the colonial era, the narrow streets of the city centre are organised in a grid, reflecting the Andalusian culture that is embodied in the architecture of the city&#39;s great houses and numerous convents and churches.

Mace Windu is one of the earliest named and created characters in Star Wars history, being the narrator of the original 1973 drafts of the original Star Wars film (later named Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope). Through the process of redrafting and copyediting, his character was removed from the original film and its two successors, but he was reintroduced in 1994 when series creator George Lucas began writing the prequel trilogy.

Aware that the climax of the prequel trilogy would eventually call for Mace Windu&#39;s death, one of the conditions was that his character die in a spectacular fashion, rather than ingloriously be killed off. 
Also, according to an interview on The Late Show with David Letterman on May 13, 2005, Windu&#39;s purple lightsaber was a personal request from Jackson to Lucas as a quid pro quo for appearing in the films, as well as a way of making the character unique and easily distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Guy is humiliated and forced to bear the brunt of his insults. His only solace is his girlfriend, Dawn, a producer at Buddy&#39;s firm. When Buddy apparently fires Guy in a phone call, Guy snaps and kidnaps Buddy in order to exact some revenge, which results in tying up Buddy and subjecting him to severe beatings, torture and paper cutting Buddy on his face and dumping salt and hot sauce on the wounds. It is later revealed that due to a botched call waiting function on Buddy&#39;s home phone, Guy hears Buddy and Dawn arranging a rendezvous at Buddy&#39;s house.

Luling was founded in 1874 as a railroad town and became a rowdy center for the cattle drivers on the Chisholm Trail. Contempt of the law by the cowboys helped Luling become known as the &quot;toughest town</IIMBTBOX:article>

He was born in Ikuno, Hyogo, Japan.
His debut as actor was the film Akanishi Kakita (&amp;#36196;&amp;#35199;&amp;#34851;&amp;#22826;; Capricious Young Man, 1936) and cast in the Kenji Mizoguchi&#39;s film Osaka Elegy (&amp;#28010;&amp;#33775;&amp;#24754;&amp;#27468;, 1936).
In company with Toshir&amp;#333; Mifune, Shimura is the actor who is most closely associated with Akira Kurosawa. Shimura appeared in more than twenty of Kurosawa&#39;s films. His roles include the doctor in Drunken Angel (1948), the veteran detective in Stray Dog (1949), the flawed lawyer in Scandal (1950), the woodcutter in Rashomon (1950),</IIMBTBOX:article>

In the same year he also obtained an artist contract from Capital Artists. Lai did not release any albums for four years. As a result, his teacher, Dai, arranged to have him signed a contract with Polygram, later known as Universal Music.
In Polygram, he released his first album &quot;Leon&quot; and subsequent album &quot;Meet In The Rain&quot; which propelled Lai into instant stardom. His debut album went gold.&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

Starting as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway, Crawford was signed to a motion picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925. Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her parts, Crawford began a campaign of self-publicity and became nationally known as a flapper by the end of the 1920s. In the 1930s, Crawford&#39;s fame rivaled MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo. Crawford often played hardworking young women who find romance and financial success.</IIMBTBOX:article>

After an absence of nearly two years from the screen, Crawford staged a comeback by starring in Mildred Pierce (1945), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1955, she became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company, through her marriage to company&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

In the Medieval period, Dorking was a prosperous agricultural and market town, benefitting from its position on the junction of a number of important roads and tracks.
In 1750, the construction of a Turnpike Road made Dorking a staging post on the route to Brighton and the coast. The Bull&amp;#8217;s Head in South Street had a famous coachman, William Broad, whose portrait hangs in Dorking Museum in West Street.

Its name derives from the River Sheaf, which runs through the city. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wider economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is 534,500 (2008&amp;#160;est.), but the wider Sheffield Urban Area, which extends beyond the city proper, had a population of 640,720 as of the 2001 census.

During the 19th century, Sheffield gained an international reputation for steel production. Many innovations were developed locally, including crucible and stainless steel, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population during the Industrial Revolution. Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1893, when it officially became the City of Sheffield. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in traditional local industries during the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.

Scottsdale was originally inhabited by Hohokam. From 800 AD to 1400 AD, this ancient civilization farmed the area and built irrigation canals.
Before European settlement, Scottsdale was a Pima village. Some Pima remained in their original homes well into the 20th century. By now, however, all Pima have either been priced out of town or moved into newer homes within Scottsdale; primarily South Scottsdale, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, or elsewhere.

The character also appeared briefly in the original story Shrek!. He currently has 6 children, with his wife, Dragon.
Donkey is seen as being very annoying and obnoxious.
He likes to sing and also has a sweet tooth. He enjoys such foods as waffles, parfait and &quot;upside-down coconut souffl&amp;#233; with mango chutney sauce.&quot; In a scene about Merlin&#39;s bonfire, Donkey&#39;s sweet tooth gets the best of him, for he sees only a fudge torte on it in the enchanted smoke.

He&#39;s always looking at the bright side of everything, trying to work it out. A happy-go-lucky donkey.&quot;
The first appearance of Donkey is when an old woman tries to sell him to Lord Farquaad&#39;s guards for money. Since Donkey refuses to talk, the captain doesn&#39;t believe that he can. By his own oral accounts, Donkey had suffered a life of abuse and ridicule before (literally) running into Shrek, a grouchy, reclusive ogre. When&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

He is the main protagonist of the book and the films. The name &quot;Shrek&quot; is derived from the German and Yiddish word &quot;Schreck&quot;/&quot;Shreck&quot;, literally meaning &quot;fear, terror.&quot; He is one of the most recognizable characters of the 21st century and probably the most famous ogre ever created.
Shrek is a large, green, physically intimidating ogre, with an accent described by Myers as &quot;a Scottish guy living in Scarborough for forty years&quot;. Although his background is something of a mystery, it is assumed that despite these traits, Shrek has</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">always been an ogre of the non-hostile kind as he loves peace and solitude and lives in a swamp (with a &quot;Beware the Ogre!&quot; sign near his home to discourage attacking villagers) and is befriended by Donkey, an excitable, hyperactive donkey. It is notable that when Shrek is first seen he is successfully scaring off villagers by roaring at them, but it later becomes obvious that they were only attacking him because he is an Ogre, not because he had done anything particularly wrong. In the first Shrek movie, during a conversation with Donkey, he laments that people &quot;judge me&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

He presides over Hell and is constantly at war with God, but far from being merciless and innately evil as Satan is often portrayed in other media, he is depicted in South Park as a soft-hearted, misunderstood anti-hero capable of compassion and genuine emotional attachment.
Many of Satan&#39;s appearances on South Park (as well as his role in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp;amp; Uncut) focus on his romantic attachments, all of which so far have been homosexual.</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In the beginning of the story, Satan is romantically involved with Saddam Hussein. As the plot of South Park progresses, Satan exiles Saddam after Saddam becomes too domineering. Satan has since had two other partners, Chris and Kevin (see &quot;Romantic Attachments&quot;, below). Satan also has a rarely seen son named Damien, who, while never specifically labeled as the Antichrist, is rather obviously based on the character from The Omen. Satan makes a cameo on the end of the current opening.
According to the audio commentary for the episode &quot;Damien&quot;, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone came up&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Alton is a small market town in Hampshire, England, to the southwest of Farnham. It had a population of 16,584 at the 1991 census, and is administered by East Hampshire district council. It also is home to Treloar College, the National Specialist college for Young Disabled People. The town is twinned with Pertuis, France  and Montecchio Maggiore, Italy.
Jane Austen lived in the nearby village of Chawton.
A Roman road ran from Chichester to Silchester and there is evidence of a Roman posting station at Neatham near Alton, probably called Vindomis, and a ford across the River Wey. Centuries later, a Saxon</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">settlement was established in the area and a large seventh century cemetery has been discovered during building excavations. It contained a selection of grave goods which included the Alton Buckle which is on display in the Curtis Museum, and is considered to be the finest piece of Anglo Saxon craftsmanship found in Hampshire. The buckle was found in the grave of a warrior, and has a silver-gilt body, set with garnets and glass.
The River Wey has its source in the town, and the name Alton comes from an Anglo-Saxon word &quot;aewielltun&quot; meaning &quot;farmstead at the source of the river&quot;.

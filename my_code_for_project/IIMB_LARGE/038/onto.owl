Landis was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Shirley Levine (n&amp;#233;e Magaziner) and Marshall David Landis, an interior decorator. His family relocated to Los Angeles when he was just four months old.
His career began as a teenager, working as a mailboy at 20th Century Fox. His first noteworthy job in Hollywood was working as an assistant director during filming MGM&#39;s Kelly&#39;s Heroes in Yugoslavia in 1969. He</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">replaced the film&#39;s original assistant director, who suffered from a nervous breakdown and was sent home by the producers. While filming he met actors Don Rickles and Donald Sutherland, both of whom he would later cast in his own films. Following this, Landis worked on many films made in Europe (especially in Italy and England), most notably, Once Upon a Time in the West, El Condor and A Town Called Bastard. Landis also worked as a stunt double.
Landis recalled:

He is also a co-founder of Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company.
He remained largely unknown to the West, until Miramax released his 1997 Princess Mononoke. By that time, his films had already enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan until Titanic (1997) came out a few months later, and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards.</IIMBTBOX:article>

Howl&#39;s Moving Castle was also nominated, but did not receive the award.
Miyazaki&#39;s films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity&#39;s relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic.

The city was estimated to have a population of 101,659 according to the Census&#39; 2008 American Community Survey released in 2009, making it Minnesota&#39;s third-largest city and the largest outside of the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">counties, had an estimated population of 182,924 as of 2009.

The area was home to nomadic Sioux, Ojibwa, and Winnebago tribes of Native Americans. In 1851, the Sioux ceded the land to Minnesota Territory in the treaties of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota, which opened the land for settlement.
Rochester itself was founded by George Head in 1854; his land claim is now part of the city&#39;s business district.&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

Lord Farquaad is the comically short-in-stature, ruthless ruler of the huge castle of Duloc. Several times in the film it is commented that, in Duloc&#39;s towering height, Farquaad may be compensating for something.
In his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his kingdom of fairy tale creatures, offering a bounty for their capture and then exiling imprisoned creatures to Shrek&#39;s swamp. However, because Farquaad is not of royal stock, he cannot become a king until he marries a princess.</IIMBTBOX:article>

Unwilling or unable (likely both) to perform the feat himself, Farquaad decides to hold a tournament to discover the knight that will rescue Princess Fiona when Donkey and Shrek arrive. Shrek and Donkey defeat the knights and Farquaad decides to send Shrek instead on the quest. Lord Farquaad agrees to move the fairy tale creatures out of Shrek&#39;s swamp if Shrek rescues Fiona. Shrek delivers Fiona to Farquaad and Farquaad immediately&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

Ladd was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas to an American father (Alan Ladd, Sr.) and an English-American mother (Ina Raleigh Ladd). His father died when he was four, and his mother relocated to Oklahoma City where she married Jim Beavers, a housepainter. The family then moved again to North Hollywood, California where Ladd became a high-school swimming and diving champion and participated in high school dramatics. He opened his own hamburger and malt shop, which he called Tiny&#39;s Patio. He worked briefly as a studio carpenter (as</IIMBTBOX:article>

Ladd began by appearing in dozens of films in small roles, including Citizen Kane in which he played one of the &quot;faceless&quot; reporters who are always shown in silhouette. He first gained some recognition with a featured role in the wartime thriller Joan of Paris, 1942.

The town was founded in the late 18th century, and grew rapidly throughout the 19th century due to the expansion of the local textile industry. It was popular as a tourist resort from the early Victorian era up to the latter half of the 20th century, due to its seaside location. It is best known</IIMBTBOX:article>

The origin of the name Carnoustie is uncertain, although it possibly derives from the Gaelic C&amp;#224;rn fheusta, meaning &#39;fort of the feast&#39;.

He graduated from the University of Michigan with an MA in Education, originally planning on a career as an English teacher. He was a student of Professor Kenneth Thorpe Rowe.

Kasdan&#39;s introduction into the film business came in the mid-1970s when he sold his script for The Bodyguard to Warner Bros. as a vehicle for Diana Ross and Steve McQueen.

Although Nielsen&#39;s acting career crosses a variety of genres in both television and films, he has achieved his greatest film successes as Commander John J. Adams in the film Forbidden Planet, and also in comic movies, including Airplane! and The Naked Gun series. His portrayal of serious characters seemingly oblivious of (and complicit in) their absurd surroundings gives Nielsen a reputation as a comedian.

Needham was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Edith May (n&amp;#233;e Robinson) and Howard Needham. He was raised in Arkansas and Missouri. Needham was a paratrooper during the Korean War, worked as a treetopper, and was a billboard model for Viceroy Cigarettes while beginning a career in Hollywood as a motion picture stuntman.
Needham&#39;s first break was as the stunt double for actor Richard Boone on the popular TV western Have Gun, Will Travel. Needham trained under John Wayne&#39;s stunt double Chuck Roberson and quickly became one</IIMBTBOX:article>

In 1971, he and fellow stuntmen Glenn Wilder, and Ronnie Rondell, created Stunts Unlimited. Needham had written a screenplay titled Smokey and the Bandit and his friend Reynolds offered him the chance to direct. The film was a huge hit, and the two&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

She was born in Tokyo, Japan, and started work as a singer from a very young age, her specialty being jazz and a level of sensuality that was somewhat shocking in a Japan as conservative as it was at the time. Her movements, even while singing, are smooth, graceful and have a trademark undulating of the hand at the audience which, with a simple imitation, can bring only her to mind.
Natsuki further shocked the Japanese audiences by appearing fully</IIMBTBOX:article>

Despite her explicit and desirable femininity, Natsuki concentrated all her energy into her art and shunned traditional values of becoming the homemaker or quitting her job after a certain age. Thus, she never married, which made her quite an icon for what is called a Kakkoii Onna, or &quot;classy woman&quot; in modern Japan today. But to the surprise of all, on the 18th of October 2007 she announced that she was engaged to marry percussionist Nobu Saito in spring 2008.

Secret agent WD-40 Dick Steele has his work cut out for him. Along with the mysterious and lovely Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent 3.14, he must rescue the kidnapped Barbara Dahl and stop the evil genius, General Rancor, from seizing control of the entire world.
Rancor was wounded in an earlier encounter and no longer has arms. However, he can &quot;arm&quot; himself by attaching robotic limbs with various weapons attached.

He was born in Ikuno, Hyogo, Japan.
His debut as actor was the film Akanishi Kakita (&amp;#36196;&amp;#35199;&amp;#34851;&amp;#22826;; Capricious Young Man, 1936) and cast in the Kenji Mizoguchi&#39;s film Osaka Elegy (&amp;#28010;&amp;#33775;&amp;#24754;&amp;#27468;, 1936).
In company with Toshir&amp;#333; Mifune, Shimura is the actor who is most closely associated with Akira Kurosawa. Shimura appeared in more than twenty of Kurosawa&#39;s films.

Although early written history tells little of the area, archaeological evidence at Holwood Park, where Stone Age and Bronze Age artefacts were found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A Roman camp was sited here; and a Roman road, the London to Lewes Way passed through the district.
With the arrival of the Normans, the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham. St George&amp;#8217;s&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

The population was 2,050 at the 2000 census. The town is named after Gouverneur Morris, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and landowner in New York.
The Town of Morristown is on the northwestern part of the county and contains a village also named Morristown. The village and town are northwest of Gouverneur.
The town, part of Macomb&#39;s Purchase, was first settled permanently around 1808 on the site of the present Morristown village.
One of the first battles in the War of 1812 was a naval battle</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">in the St. Lawrence River between two warships.
The town was established in 1821 from part of the Town of Oswegatchie, where it was known as &quot;Haque.&quot;. Morristown was reduced twice to make new towns: Hammond (1827) and Macomb (1841).
Due to the lack of waterpower, a windmill was erected in 1825.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 59.4&amp;#160;square miles (153.9&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;), of which, 45.9&amp;#160;square miles (118.8&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;) of it is land and 13.6&amp;#160;square miles (35.1&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;) of it (22.83%) is water.

Laughton showed keen and serious interest in the pioneering possibilities of film, and later other media, such as radio, recordings, and TV, proving that quality work could be made available to audiences other than theatre-goers.</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">He became an American citizen in 1950.
Laughton was born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, the son of Robert Laughton, a Yorkshire hotel keeper, and his wife Elizabeth (n&amp;#233;e Conlon). His mother was a devout Roman Catholic and he attended Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit school, in Lancashire, England. He served during World War I (in which he was gassed) first with the 2/1st Battalion of the Huntingdonshire Cyclist Regiment and later with the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment.
He started work in the family hotel business, while participating in amateur theatricals in Scarborough. Finally&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

The city was founded by the Romans in 71&amp;#160;AD. They called it Eboracum, a name perhaps derived from one used by the British tribes who inhabited the area.

It is located in central Namibia in the Khomas Highland plateau area around 1,700&amp;#160;metres (5,600&amp;#160;ft) above sea level. The 2001 census determined Windhoek&#39;s population was 233,529. A population influx from all over Namibia has caused researchers to estimate the figure to be well over 300,000.
Due to its relative size Windhoek is even more so than other capitals the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country. Virtually every national enterprise has its headquarters</IIMBTBOX:article>

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">here. The University of Namibia is here, as is the country&#39;s only theatre, most of Namibia&#39;s governmental institutions, and all major media bodies. City of Windhoek&#39;s budget nearly equals that of all other Namibian local authorities combined.
The city of Windhoek is traditionally known by two names: /Ai//Gams, (Khoekhoe: hot springs) and Otjomuise (Otjiherero: place of steam). Both traditional names reference the hot springs near today&#39;s city centre.
Theories vary on how the place got its modern name of Windhoek. Most believe the name Windhoek is derived from the Afrikaans word Wind-Hoek&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

During the colonial period and at independence, the country was known as Dahomey. It was renamed on November 30, 1975, to Benin after the body of water on which the country lies, the Bight of Benin, which had in turn been named after the Benin Empire.

Solihull</IIMBTBOX:article>

The town has existed since medieval times when it was founded as a market town and it later became an important coaching and mail coach stop. Solihull probably came into being about a thousand years ago, as a clearing in the forest to which people would come to trade.

Dorking began life as a small staging post on Stane Street, the Roman Road which linked London to Chichester on the English Channel.
Dorking appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as the Manor of Dorchinges. It was held by William the Conqueror. Its domesday assets were: one church, 3 mills worth 15s 4d, 16 ploughs, 3&amp;#160;acres (1.2&amp;#160;ha) of meadow, woodland and herbage worth 88 hogs. It rendered &amp;#163;18..

In the Medieval period, Dorking was a prosperous agricultural and market town, benefitting from its position on the junction of a number of important roads and tracks.
In 1750, the construction of a Turnpike Road made Dorking a staging post on the route to Brighton and the coast. The Bull&amp;#8217;s Head in South Street had a famous coachman, William Broad, whose portrait hangs in Dorking Museum in West Street.

The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaid&amp;#333; from Honsh&amp;#363;, although the two islands are connected by the underwater Seikan Tunnel. The largest city on Hokkaid&amp;#333; is its capital, Sapporo, which is also its only ordinance-designated city.
Archeologists theorize that Hokkaid&amp;#333; was settled by Ainu, Gilyak, and Oroke 20,000 years ago. The Nihon Shoki, finished in 720, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaid&amp;#333; in recorded history.</IIMBTBOX:article>

One of the places Hirafu went to was called Watarishima (&amp;#28193;&amp;#23798;), which is often believed to be present-day Hokkaid&amp;#333;. However, many theories exist in relation to the details of this event, including the location of Watarishima and the common belief that the Emishi in Watarishima were the ancestors of the present-day Ainu people.

Scottsdale was originally inhabited by Hohokam. From 800 AD to 1400 AD, this ancient civilization farmed the area and built irrigation canals.
Before European settlement, Scottsdale was a Pima village. Some Pima remained in their original homes well into the 20th century. By now, however, all Pima have either been priced out of town or moved into newer homes within Scottsdale; primarily South Scottsdale, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, or elsewhere.

His films include Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II, True Romance, Crimson Tide, Enemy of the State, Man on Fire and D&amp;#233;j&amp;#224; Vu. His elder brother is fellow film director Ridley Scott.
Born in North Shields, then in Northumberland, Tony Scott&#39;s first foray into filmmaking was not from behind the camera, but rather in front of it. At the age of 16, Tony appeared in Boy and Bicycle, a short film marking the directorial debut of his then 23 year-old brother Ridley. He followed in his elder brother&#39;s footsteps, studying at Grangefield</IIMBTBOX:article>
        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">School, West Hartlepool College of Art and Sunderland Art School, the last for a fine arts degree. He subsequently graduated from the Royal College of Art, fully intending to become a painter. It was only the success of his elder brother&#39;s fledging television commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that turned his attentions towards film.
&quot;Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, &#39;Don&#39;t go to the BBC, come to me first.&#39; I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him &#39;Come work with me and within a year you&#39;ll have a Ferrari&#39;. And he did&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

Beatty was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Margaret Fortney (n&amp;#233;e Lennis) and Charles William Beatty. He has a sister, Mary Margaret, and a brother. In 1947, Beatty began singing in gospel and barbershop quartets, in St. Matthews, Kentucky, as well as at his local church.

Starting as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway, Crawford was signed to a motion picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925. Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her parts, Crawford began a campaign of self-publicity and became nationally known as a flapper by the end of the 1920s. In the 1930s, Crawford&#39;s fame rivaled MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo. Crawford often played hardworking young women who find romance and financial success.</IIMBTBOX:article>

Gaberones, derived from Gaborone&#39;s Village, was named after Chief Gaborone of the BaTlokwa, whose home village, now called Tlokweng, was across the river from the Government Camp, the name of the colonial government headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

John Cho assumed the role of the character in the 2009 film Star Trek.
George Takei recalled Gene Roddenberry wanted the character to represent all of Asia, which symbolized the peace of the Trek universe in spite of the numerous wars in the continent. Roddenberry did not want a nationally specific surname, so he looked at</IIMBTBOX:article>

Novelist Vonda McIntyre first presents &#39;Hikaru&#39; as the character&#39;s first name in the novel The Entropy Effect.

Woods is known for starring in films such as Once Upon a Time in America, Ghosts of Mississippi, Salvador and Casino and as the Disney villain Hades in Hercules.
Woods was born in Vernal, Utah. His father, Gail Peyton Woods, was an army intelligence officer who died in 1960 following routine surgery. His mother, Martha A. (n&amp;#233;e Smith), operated a pre-school after her husband&#39;s death and re-married to Thomas E. Dixon. Woods grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island, where he attended Pilgrim High School.
Woods chose to pursue his undergraduate studies</IIMBTBOX:article>

He dropped out of MIT in 1969 just before his graduation in order to pursue a career in acting.

Its character changed during the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, when the power of the emperor gradually weakened in favour of the princes.

The Empire&#39;s territorial extent varied over its history, but at its peak it encompassed the Kingdom of Germany, the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Burgundy; for much of its history the Empire consisted of hundreds of smaller sub-units, principalities, duchies,&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

The movie portrays a young newlywed couple, Kristy and Jake Briggs played by Elizabeth McGovern and Kevin Bacon, who try to cope with being married and what is expected of them by their parents. Jake must also deal with the fantasy woman of his dreams. The film is largely a parody of traditional 1980s suburban life and the cultural expectations that come along with it.

The City of Washington was originally a separate municipality within the Territory of Columbia until an act of Congress in 1871 effectively merged the City and the Territory into a single entity called the District of Columbia. It is for this reason that the city, while legally named the District of Columbia, is known as Washington, D.C. The city shares its</IIMBTBOX:article>

The city is located on the north bank of the Potomac River and is bordered by the states of Virginia to the southwest and Maryland to the other sides. The District has a resident population of 599,657; because of commuters from the surrounding suburbs, its population rises to over one&amp;#160;million during the workweek.

In the 19th century, coal deposits were discovered, ensuring that the town grew rapidly as an industrial centre, with industries such as spring, gun and nail making developing. Most of the coal deposits were found below the ground a mile or so west of&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>

The character also appeared briefly in the original story Shrek!. He currently has 6 children, with his wife, Dragon.
Donkey is seen as being very annoying and obnoxious.
He likes to sing and also has a sweet tooth. He enjoys such foods as waffles, parfait and &quot;upside-down coconut souffl&amp;#233; with mango chutney sauce.&quot; In a scene about Merlin&#39;s bonfire, Donkey&#39;s sweet tooth gets the best of him, for he sees only a fudge torte on it in the enchanted smoke.

He&#39;s always looking at the bright side of everything, trying to work it out. A happy-go-lucky donkey.&quot;
The first appearance of Donkey is when an old woman tries to sell him to Lord Farquaad&#39;s guards for money. Since Donkey refuses to talk, the captain doesn&#39;t believe that he can. By his own oral accounts, Donkey had suffered a life of abuse and ridicule before (literally) running into Shrek, a grouchy, reclusive ogre. When&lt;/p&gt;</IIMBTBOX:article>
